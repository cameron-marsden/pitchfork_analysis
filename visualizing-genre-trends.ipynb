    "This Dash visual shows Pitchfork's distribution of Best New Music labels and aggregated year-end rankings (scored using Album of the Year's rubric) broken down by genre. Trends for niche genres like \"Global\" and \"Jazz\" yield little information due to small sample sizes. On the other hand, more substantive genres like Pop/R&B and Experimental show shifting sentiments over the past 18 years:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Experimental music has suffered declines in review accolades and end-year lists since Pitchfork first introduced their 'Best New Music' stamp in 2003. During that year, experimental albums made up 23% of all 'Best New Music' titles compared to 7% in 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pitchfork went through a \"Poptimist\" renaissance in 2010—jumping from essentially zero recognition in 2009 to comprising one-fifth of all best new albums in 2010. The genre has continued to succeed thorughout the past decade, peaking in 2016 when Pop/R&B albums dominated the year-end list with Solange, Frank Ocean, and Beyoncé taking the top three spots. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Rap had moderate success in the early-mid 2000's, but it's presence in postive reviews and year-end lists dwindled through the late 2000s. Similar to Pop/R&B, Pitchfork reviewed Rap albums much more positively during the past decade. (Kanye West's *My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy* still remains as the decade's only new album to achieve a perfect 10/10 review.) Recently, Pitchfork placed 14 rap albums in their top 50 albums of 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "So has Pitchfork shifted its focus to more mainstream genres during the past decade? Perhaps. The data I scraped and modeled certainly supports a shifting perspective. I personally believe that artists have produced more genre-bending albums recently. For example, St. Vincent and Deafheaven have landed on three of the decade's year-end lists. Pitchfork defines St. Vincent's albums as Rock and Deafheaven's as Metal. I would argue that St. Vincent's 2011 album *Strange Mercy* is as much experimental as it is rock. Annie Clark herself refers to her most recent album, *MASSEDUCTION*, as a confessional pop record. It's just as difficult to classify Deafheaven. Are they a black metal band? According to many black metal fans on the black metal subreddit, No. Wikipedia suggests that the band's genre is \"blackgaze\" (a portmanteau of \"black metal\" and \"shoegaze\"). I would argue that their sound is more akin to post-rock than anything else. \n",
    "\n",
    "It was fun to classify and analyze the nine genres Pitchfork uses to tag album reviews, and it's easy to communicate your music preferences to others using broad terms like \"Country\" or \"Rap.\" On the other hand, these rigid genres often turn people away from music they might otherwise enjoy. I don't think that Pitchfork's views in 2010 changed as drastically as the visualization above suggests. Instead, I think our definition of genre rapidly became outdated in a world that is always sharing ideas online. Perhaps when I revisit this dataset, I'll look into unsupervised methods to create my own definition of genre—one that generates categories like \"blackgaze\" to better represent nuanced albums. "
